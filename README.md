Project Overview
This project implements a basic User Authentication System that includes a Login Page and a Registration Page with password validation.

Features
Login Page:

Allows users to log in by entering their email/username and password.
If the login credentials are incorrect, an error message is displayed.
Registration Page:

New users can register by providing their email/username, password, and confirm password.
Password Cross Verification: Ensures that the password and confirm password fields match before allowing the user to proceed with registration.
If the passwords do not match, the user is prompted with an error to re-enter the passwords correctly.
Validation:

Password and Confirm Password Match: During registration, the system checks that the password and confirm password are identical before submitting the form.
